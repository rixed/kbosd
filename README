This keyboard is intended to be used in an OpenMoko FreeRunner, but could be 
useful on other gadgets as well. The idea is to overlay the keyboard to the 
main display and grab the mouse events, in a way that works with any 
applications (thats does not require the mouse events).

It is largely inspired by the fatfingershell.

You can configure many things using environment variables, including font, 
color and keys layout.

Font
----

By default, kbosd may use a font too small to be comfortably read. I suggest 
you install one of these X11 font packages :

- xfonts-100dpi, and export KBOSD_FONT="-etl-*-*-*-*-*-40-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
- tv-fonts, and export KBOSD_FONT="-xxl-*-*-*-*-*-39-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

These are the one I like best, but I haven't tried many.
Use xfontsel utility to choose your own !

Layout
------

You may not like the default layout which mimics a standard qwerty keyboard. 
For instance, you may prefer a localized layout, or to have the keys 
alphabetically ordered. Hopefully you can define your own layout in a file,
and tell kbosd about it using the environment variable KBOSD_LAYOUT.

The layout file consist of a sequence of "Name1 Name2 keycode boolean".  
Everything is delimiter by blank space (space, tab, new line, whatever).  
Name1 must be at most 3 chars and is the name of the key when shift is off, 
while name2 is the name of the key when shift is on (most of special keys have 
the same name with or without shift). Then keycode is the keycode of the key 
(you can find it with the tool xev for instance). The boolean (0 or 1) tells 
whether this key can be held pressed or not (useful for shift, control and 
alt).

Also, as a special exception, when name is "___" it is replaced by spaces (as 
spaces are otherwise parsed as delimiters). And there are two special keycodes 
: 0, which is for the "change color" key, and 1 which is for the "toggle keys" 
key.

So, every keys are read from this file one by one, starting at the topleft key 
of the first key maps (36 keys), then the second key maps (again 36 keys), 
then the 2 bottom lines (12 keys).

You can use the provided default.layout as a template for your 
experimentations.
